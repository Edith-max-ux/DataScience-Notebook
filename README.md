# DataScience-Notebook

# Final Project: Data Science
## Introduction
In this notebook, we will explore common tools and languages used in data science. Basic code examples for performing arithmetic operations will also be provided.
## Data Science Languages
Some of the most commonly used languages in data science are:
- Python
- R
- SQL
- Julia
## Data Science Libraries
The most used data science libraries include:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
## Data Science Tools
| Tool                  | Description                                        |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Jupyter Notebooks     | Interactive environment for writing code           |
| RStudio               | Development environment for R                      |
| Apache Hadoop         | Framework for big data processing                  |
| Tableau               | Data visualization tool                            |
## Examples of Arithmetic Expressions
Some common arithmetic expressions are:
- Addition: `5 + 3`
- Multiplication: `6 * 7`
# Multiplication and addition
x = 5 * 7
y = x + 10
y
# Convert minutes to hours
minutes = 120
hours = minutes / 60
hours
## Objectives
- Learn the main languages and libraries in data science.
- Understand how data science tools are used.
- Perform basic calculations in Python.
